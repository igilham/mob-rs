# Tool for remote mob programming

This is a [Rust][rust] port of a simple tool called [`mob`][mob] which I found on [Remote Mob Programming][remote]. I put it together as a simple exercise for learning some aspects of the Rust language.

## Installation

First get the rust toolchain installer [rustup][rustup] and use it to install the latest stable Rust toolchain.

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/igilham/mob-rs --tag v1.0.0
```

[mob]: https://github.com/remotemobprogramming/mob
[remote]: https://www.remotemobprogramming.org/
[rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/
[rustup]: https://rustup.rs/
